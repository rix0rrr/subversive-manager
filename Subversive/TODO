CORE FEATURES


USABILITY
    - Retrieve fullname of users already in the permissions list
    - Multiselect in lists
    - Editable configuration from front-end
    - Remember which directories are expanded. Only auto-expand the directories
      that have SET permissions under them.
    - Refresh of the directory tree is too slow (and the visual jumping is jarring)

    - Intelligent UserRetrieval caching on client
    - LDAP


AESTHETICS
    - Show group members preview in group list ("a, b and 3 more...")
    - Styling 
    - A logo!
    - Favicon


DEPLOYMENT
    - Configuration
    - Setup wizard
    - Read authentication from Apache proxy (REMOTE_USER et. al.)
